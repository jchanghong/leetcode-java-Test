 * Description: 
 * 
 * There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n - 1. 
 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to
 * first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1] 
 * 
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, 
 * is it possible for you to finish all courses? 
 * 
 * For example: 
 * 
 *      2, [[1,0]] 
 * There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have 
 * finished course 0. So it is possible. 
 * 
 *      2, [[1,0],[0,1]] 
 * There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have 
 * finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should also have finished 
 * course 1. So it is impossible.
