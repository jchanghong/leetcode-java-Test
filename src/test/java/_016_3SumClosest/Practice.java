/**
 *************************************************************************
 * Description: 
 * 
 * Given an array S of n integers, find three integers in S such that the 
 * sum is closest to a given number, target. Return the sum of the three 
 * integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution. 
 * 
 * For example, given array S = {-1 2 1 -4}, and target = 1. 
 * The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
