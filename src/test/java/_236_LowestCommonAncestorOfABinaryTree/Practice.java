 * Description:
 * 
 * Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes 
 * in the tree. 
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor 
 * is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has 
 * both v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).” 
 *

 *       7    4
 * For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 5 and 1 is 3. Another 
 * example is LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of 
 * itself according to the LCA definition.
