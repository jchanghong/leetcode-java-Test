 * Description:
 * 
 * You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new 
 * product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the 
 * quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous 
 * version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad. 
 * 
 * Suppose you have n versions [1, 2, ..., n] and you want to find out the 
 * first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad. 
 * 
 * You are given an API bool isBadVersion(version) which will return whether 
 * version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You 
 * should minimize the number of calls to the API.
