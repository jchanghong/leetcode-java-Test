 * Description:
 * 
 * There are a row of n houses, each house can be painted with one of the k colors. 
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is different. 
 * You have to paint all the houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color. 
 * 
 * The cost of painting each house with a certain color is represented by a n x k cost matrix. 
 * 
 * For example, costs[0][0] is the cost of painting house 0 with color 0; 
 * costs[1][2] is the cost of painting house 1 with color 2, and so on... 
 * Find the minimum cost to paint all houses. 
 * 
 * Note: All costs are positive integers. 
 * 
 * Follow up: Could you solve it in O(nk) runtime?
