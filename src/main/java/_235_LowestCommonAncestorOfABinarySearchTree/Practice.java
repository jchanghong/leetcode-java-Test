 * Description:
 *
 * Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two 
 * given nodes in the BST. 
 * 
 * According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor 
 * is defined between two nodes v and w as the lowest node in T that has both 
 * v and w as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).” 
 *      _______6______

 * 0      _4       7       9
 *        /  \
 *       3   5
 *       
 * For example, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of nodes 2 and 8 is 6. Another 
 * example is LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of 
 * itself according to the LCA definition.
