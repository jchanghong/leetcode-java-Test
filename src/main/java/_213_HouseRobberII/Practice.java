 * Description: 
 * 
 * After robbing those houses on that street, the thief has found himself 
 * a new place for his thievery so that he will not get too much attention. 
 * This time, all houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means 
 * the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, the security 
 * system for these houses remain the same as for those in the previous street. 
 * 
 * Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money
 * of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob 
 * tonight without alerting the police.
