/**
 ***************************************************************************
 * Description:
 * 
 * Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks. 
 *  push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
 *  pop()   -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
 *  peek()  -- Get the front element.
 *  empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
 * Notes: 
 * You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to 
 * top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
 * Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may 
 * simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as 
 * you use only standard operations of a stack.
 * 
 * You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek 
 * operations will be called on an empty queue).
